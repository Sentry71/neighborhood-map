# Neighborhood Map - Project 5
---
In this project, the task is to develop a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood to visit. Additional functionality is added to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

The purpose of the project is to combine all previous lessons learned during the Front End Web Development Nanodegree into one complex project.

### How to Use

Link: http://sentry71.github.io/neighborhood-map

The screen will show a Google Map of St. Louis, Missouri, with several locations of interest set up as pins on the map. Locations can be chosen by:
1. Clicking on a marker directly
2. Clicking on an item in the list on the bottom right of the screen (for desktop and tablet)

The user can also limit the list of markers by typing into the Filter List box above the list. This will filter the list down to matching locations.

A box will pop up over the chosen marker, giving some information about the location. Additional pictures (pulled from photo feeds searched via the Flickr API) will be displayed.
